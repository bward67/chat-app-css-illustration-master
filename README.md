It was fun learning how to make an arrow using 2 border-sides and then rotating it.

Creating the capsule background images with the correct border-radius and making it responsive was a struggle and I fell a little short as they are not perfect but overall I am happy with it and looking forward to the next FEM challenge.

And for once ... I did the Bonus. So - yayee me :)
I LOVE YOU FEM - you encourage me to learn things that I may not have otherwise!
